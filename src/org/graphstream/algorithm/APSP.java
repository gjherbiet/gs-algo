/**
 * All-pair shortest paths lengths.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class defines algorithms that compute all shortest paths lengths between
 * all pair of nodes in a given graph. This algorithm uses the Floyd-Warshal
 * algorithm, that effectively runs in O(n^3). This may seems a very large
 * complexity, however this algorithm may perform better than running several
 * Dijkstra on all node pairs of the graph when the graph becomes dense.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that as is, this algorithm does not store the paths it only stores the
 * lengths of the minimum paths (however there is an option that allows to
 * reconstruct paths in linear time, taking advantage of the fact we computed
 * all the shortest paths). The storage is made directly in the graph. For each
 * node of the graph, a {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.APSP.APSPInfo}
 * attribute is stored. The name of this attribute is
 * {@link org.graphstream.algorithm.APSP.APSPInfo#ATTRIBUTE_NAME}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm can use directed graphs and only compute paths according to
 * this direction. You can choose to ignore edge orientation by calling
 * {@link #setDirected(boolean)} method with "false" as value (or use the
 * appropriate constructor).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can also specify that edges have "weights" or "importance" that value
 * them. You store these values as attributes on the edges. The default name for
 * these attributes is "weight" but you can specify it using the
 * {@link #setWeightAttributeName(String)} method (or by using the appropriate
 * constructor). The weight attribute must contain an object that implements
 * java.lang.Number.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * How to rebuild the shortest path without storing them: we use the fact that
 * we compute ALL the shortest paths between ALL pairs of nodes. Therefore
 * instead of storing in each node the complete shortest path toward each other
 * node, we only store the target node name and if the path is made of more than
 * one edge, one "pass-by" node. As all shortest path that is made of more than
 * one edge is necessarily made of two other shortest paths, it is easy to
 * reconstruct a shortest path between two arbitrary nodes knowing only a
 * pass-by node.
 * </p>
