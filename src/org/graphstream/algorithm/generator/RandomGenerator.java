/**
 * Random graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator creates random graphs of any size. Calling {@link #begin()}
 * put one unique node in the graph, then {@link #nextEvents()} will add a new
 * node each time it is called and connect this node randomly to others.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The generator tries to generate nodes with random connections, with each node
 * having in average a given degree. The law in a Poisson law, however, the way
 * this generator works, adding node after node, perturbs this process. We
 * should first allocate all the needed nodes, then create edges. However, we
 * create nodes at the same rate as edges. The more nodes are added the more the
 * degree distribution curve is shifted toward the right.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator has the ability to add randomly chosen numerical values on
 * arbitrary attributes on edges or nodes of the graph, and to randomly choose a
 * direction for edges.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A list of attributes can be given for nodes and edges. In this case each new
 * node or edge added will have this attribute and the value will be a randomly
 * chosen number. The range in which these numbers are chosen can be specified.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, edges are not oriented. It is possible to ask orientation, in
 * which case the direction is chosen randomly.
 * </p>
