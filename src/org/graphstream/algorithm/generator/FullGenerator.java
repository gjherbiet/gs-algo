/**
 * Full graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Probably not very useful, still sometimes needed. This generator creates
 * fully connected graphs of any size. Calling {@link #begin()} put one unique
 * node in the graph, then {@link #nextEvents()} will add a new node each time
 * it is called.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This generator has the ability to add randomly chosen numerical values on
 * arbitrary attributes on edges or nodes of the graph, and to randomly choose a
 * direction for edges.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A list of attributes can be given for nodes and edges. In this case each new
 * node or edge added will have this attribute and the value will be a randomly
 * chosen number. The range in which these numbers are chosen can be specified.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * By default, edges are not oriented. It is possible to ask orientation, in
 * which case the direction is chosen randomly.
 * </p>
