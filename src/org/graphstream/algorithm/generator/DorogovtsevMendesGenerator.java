/**
 * Dorogovtsev - Mendes graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Generates a graph using the Dorogovtsev - Mendes algorithm. This starts by
 * creating three nodes and tree edges, making a triangle, and then add one node
 * at a time. Each time a node is added, an edge is chosen randomly and the node
 * is connected to the two extremities of this edge.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This process generates a power-low degree distribution, as nodes that have
 * more edges have more chances to be selected since their edges are more
 * represented in the edge set.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm often generates graphs that seem more suitable than the simple
 * preferential attachment implemented in the PreferentialAttachmentGenerator
 * class (despite the fact more complex and useful preferential attachment
 * generators could be realized in the future).
 * </p>
 * 
 * </p> The Dorogovtsev - Mendes algorithm always produce planar graphs. </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The more this generator is iterated, the more nodes are generated. It can
 * therefore generate trees of any size.
 * </p>
